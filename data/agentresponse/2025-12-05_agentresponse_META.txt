In day trading, the VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) is used to assess trade quality and market trends. Traders buy below VWAP as it indicates a potentially undervalued stock and sell above it when stocks seem overvalued. It's also used as a dynamic support/resistance level; prices bouncing off VWAP suggest trend continuation, while crossovers may signal reversals. Combine VWAP with other indicators for confirmation. Monitor volume spikes and price movement around VWAP for entry and exit signals. Adjust strategies based on time frame and market conditions for best results.,39829951
